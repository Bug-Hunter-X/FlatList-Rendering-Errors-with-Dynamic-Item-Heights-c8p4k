The solution involves using the `getItemLayout` prop in the FlatList to explicitly define the layout of each item. This allows the FlatList to accurately position items regardless of their varying heights.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({item}) => (
    <View style={{ height: item.height }}>
      {/* Item content */}
    </View>
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => (
    { length: data[index].height, offset: data[index].height * index, index }
  )}
/>
```

This ensures that the FlatList has precise information about each item's height, eliminating the rendering issues caused by dynamic heights.
