This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The component renders items efficiently by reusing views, but if the item height varies significantly, it can lead to inaccurate calculations and unexpected rendering behavior.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({item}) => (
    <View style={{ height: item.height }}>
      {/* Item content */}
    </View>
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

If `item.height` is dynamic and not consistently calculated, the FlatList may struggle to estimate item positions, resulting in incorrect scrolling, overlapping items, or blank spaces.
