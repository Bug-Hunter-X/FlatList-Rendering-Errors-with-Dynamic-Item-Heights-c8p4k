# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue with Dynamic Item Heights

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Native's FlatList component with items of varying heights.  The problem arises from the FlatList's internal view recycling mechanism struggling to accurately calculate item positions when heights are dynamic and not consistently determined.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file shows how a FlatList with dynamic item heights can lead to inaccurate scrolling, overlapping items, or blank spaces. This is because the FlatList's virtualization relies on a consistent estimate of item heights to efficiently render and scroll the list.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that uses the `getItemLayout` prop to explicitly provide the layout information for each item in the FlatList. This allows for more precise rendering and scrolling, even with dynamic item heights.
